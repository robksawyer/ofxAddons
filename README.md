# ruicode Overview
> Libraries, addons and utilities for [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/).

## ofxCvConvexityDefects
> OpenFrameworks addon which tracks blobs and calculates convexity defects. Uses the ofxOpenCv addon

## ofxTabletOSX
> OpenFrameworks addon which allows the use of graphic tablets in OSX. includes pen proximity and drawing events which are separated from regular mouse events

## ofxSTL
> Addon for OpenFrameworks to import and export STL 3d models in both ASCII and binary forms

## ofxCvBrightnessContrast
> Addon for OpenFrameworks which applies brightness and contrast transformations to images in the ofxOpenCv addon. Adapted from the source of the "OpenCv - Processing and Java Library" here: http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv/


## ofxMarchingCubes
> Addon for OpenFrameworks implementing a marching cubes algorithm based in this paper by Paul Bourke local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/polygonise/ now with added STL 3d model export

## ofx3DUtils
> Handy set of functions for different 3d topics. Includes lights, camera and 3d primitives. Created together with Jonas Jongejan. Hosted in its own repository at ofx3dutisl.googlecode.com

## ofxNoise
> Ported Toxi's noise classes into an OpenFrameworks addon. Includes Perlin noise and Simplex noise.

## ofxRuiPhysics2d
> Simple 2d physics addon for OF using the Verlet integrator as explained by this article: http://www.teknikus.dk/tj/gdc2001.htm it includes particles, collisions and springs.

## ofxRuiPhysics3d
> Simple port of the ofxRuiPhysics2d library into 3d space

## ofxFadable
> Simple OpenFrameworks addon to create visual content with time based fade in and out capabilities. Its based on a simple to extend class and currently inlcudes fadable video player, fadable video grabber and fadable color rectangle.

## ofxCvEasyWarper
> Addon for OpenFrameworks which wraps the image warping functionality in ofxOpenCV and adds a simple GUI and load/save functionality.

## ofxRuiThread
> OpenFrameworks addon which extends the ofxThread addon and adds some useful methods to control and query threads

## ofxCvOpticalFlowPyrLK
> Small OpenFrameworks addon that wraps opencv's Lukas Kanade optical flow pyramid functionality. To be used with ofxOpenCV.
